# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! I have designed this web application to provide a dynamic visual representation of classic sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

**Live Demo:** [Sorting Visualizer](https://sortingvisualizerbyfeza.netlify.app/) 

## Purpose

I created this project with two main goals in mind. Firstly, it was an opportunity for me to enhance my proficiency in web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Secondly, I wanted to provide a supportive resource for beginners in programming, offering them a hands-on, interactive tool for comprehending sorting algorithms through visualization.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

The application currently supports the following sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Insertion Sort**
3. **Selection Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**

Feel free to explore and experiment with different algorithms to deepen your understanding of sorting processes. Happy sorting!
